teach_rubypi
============

A repository for developing curriculum to teach Ruby on a Raspberry Pi platform.

I have a goal of teaching 10,000 kids to program by 2020.

## And I need your help.

Teaching RubyPi is about taking tools that are inexpensive, open source, and ripe with potential and combining them in ways that allow anyone, of any age and experience, to begin programming. Using a hands-on, gradual approach to teaching, we can provide a basic education in programming Ruby on a Linux OS that is limited by only our individual imagination. 

### Can you imagine facilitating the next generation of designers and developers using a computer setup costing under $100? 

I'm excited to begin work on this collaborative, open source curriculum as it leaves the dark corners of my basement workshop and dives into being. Star this repo for updates and information, and please -- **WATCH AND CONTRIBUTE**. 

## I cannot do this work alone. 

With our combined knowledge, time, and devotion, we can create a programming curriculum to far exceed my dream. I can't wait to share it with you.
